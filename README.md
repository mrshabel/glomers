GLOMERS

A series of distributed systems challenges that leverage Maelstrom to test distributed workloads and ensure systems are resilient and can survive all network delays and partitions.

The whole point of this is to ensure applications can tolerate network partition among distributed systems, basically CAP's theorem in practice.

## Prerequisites

-   [Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom) - A tool for simulating a toy distributed system that spins up multiple clients to interact with our servers.

## Usage

## Projects

-   `echo`: a simple echo server to demonstrate working with maelstrom in a distributed environment
